# STOXLY
We are finding a solution for the clearly existing problem in indian shopes . Using Inter-Branch Transfer (IBT) Automation &amp; Smart Inventory Movement.
Basic solution example for this problem is given below:
Major Inventory in delhi having all stocks.The distribution of stocks are done weekly based on rate of sale in each shops.
in india kerala kochi 
store A in lulu mall
store B in forum mall
store C in obron mall
Store A in lulu mall sell shoes at high sale rate , Store B in obron mall has low rate of sale , Store C in forum Mall has moderate sale rate.By analysing Rate Of Sale (ROS) Smart Replenishment Engine helps to move product from low sales store to high sales store.Insted of letting the shoes remain as dead stock or selling them at heavey discounts, the system flags them for redistribution.

The Donor-Receiver Optimization Algorithm then selects Store B as the best donor and Store A as the best receiver, while ensuring Store B keeps minimum safety stock. The shoes are transferred from Store B to Store A, where they sell quickly. As a result, dead stock is reduced, unnecessary discounts are avoided, customer demand is met efficiently, and the brand improves profitability without producing additional inventory.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For that we are creating a website it is sepparately accessed by stores and inventory. 
Inventory is the Brain.
Stores are cells.
Every stores are registerd to a single website created by the inventory admins.
We are implementing an auto detecting system in every shops which is linked with this website.
If a store have a shotage of an item it will automaticaly detect it and give an alert to the store owner . If the store owner give request to the website it will detect the nearby shops which have this item as a deadstock.
And the transfer deadstock requst will given to the available store.And when the both stores are approved the unit exchange department working under STOXLY will do the transfer as fast as it can.
At the same time the distribution from inventory is done based on the weather and seasonal conditions in different places which is automaticaly ditected by the ai implimentaion in the website .
So unwanted items will not be deliverd to the shopes.

"Pre-emptive Rebalancing" (The Visionary)
Instead of waiting 45 days for "Dead Stock" (Zero-ROS) detection, the system uses Predictive Velocity Modeling.
The Implementation: After just 7 days of a new product launch, the system compares the "Sales Curve" of Store A vs. Store B.
If Store A is selling at 110% of the forecast and Store B is at 40%, the system initiates a "Early-Life Rebalance."
By moving the stock in Week 2 instead of Week 8, you capture the full-price trend while the product is still "fresh" and "trending" on social media. This eliminates the need for any discount later.

Summary: The "Next-Gen" Architecture
If you were to pitch this to a Tier-1 Indian retailer (like Reliance Retail, Aditya Birla Fashion, or Tata Trent), your "Greatest Implementation" slide would look like this:
The Unified Inventory "Digital Twin"
Sensing: Uses AI to monitor not just sales, but local weather, Instagram trends, and regional festivals.
Simulation: Calculates the "Logistics vs. Margin" trade-off in real-time.
Action: Executes "Pre-emptive Transfers" during the first 14 days of a product life cycle, ensuring 90% of stock sells at Full MRP without ever hitting the "End of Season Sale" rack.
Why this solves the "Indian Shop" problem specifically:
In India, the "Distance vs. Diversity" problem is huge. We have huge distances between cities and massive diversity in what people wear.
A "Manual" manager in Mumbai cannot possibly know that a specific shade of Yellow is trending in Lucknow due to a local festival. Your system becomes the "National Merchandiser" who is present in every street of India simultaneously.
